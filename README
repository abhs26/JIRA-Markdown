This code is fork from https://bitbucket.org/bbaker/atlassian-markdown/overview

I have re-structured and bundled it with the latest SDK and tested with latest JIRA server.
There is only one plugin which is for JIRA only, Confluence is not supported yet !!
If I will get time I will get my hands on enhancing this plugin

Cheers!!

ATLASSIAN MARKDOWN PLUGIN
==========================

This plugin that adds Markdown rendering to JIRA This has been released as open source. 

This provides a full field renderer AND a {markdown} macro that can be placed inside exiisting wiki rendered fields. 

The markdown is provided by a combination of Markdown4J and PageDown which is the code the StackOverFlow editor is based on.

JSoup is used under the covers to perform XSS whitelisting

Ideas for future improvements are :

 * Use GitHub Markdown (GMD) which is that much better for coders
 * Unify the client side and server side markup generation
 * Provide a Confluence plugin for the Markdown inclusion inside macros
